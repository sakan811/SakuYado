# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

SakuYado is a hotel value comparison web application that helps users find the best value accommodations by calculating a "Review/Price Score" (Rating รท Price). The application follows a component-based architecture with centralized state management.

## Application Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling
- **React Context + useReducer** for state management

### Core Architecture Pattern

**Component-Based Architecture** with **Context API**:

1. **Modular Components**: Reusable UI components with clear responsibilities
2. **Centralized State**: HotelContext manages all hotel-related state
3. **Separation of Concerns**: UI, business logic, and data management are distinct
4. **Type-Safe Development**: Full TypeScript integration

### Key Decisions

- **Context API over Redux**: Simpler, built-in solution with predictable state updates
- **LocalStorage Persistence**: Hotel data persists across browser sessions
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for mobile (375px) with desktop support (1280px+)

## Component Architecture

### UI Component Library

Reusable components in `src/components/ui/`:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Button** | Interactive actions with variants (primary, secondary, danger) |
| **Input** | Form fields with labels, icons, and error handling |
| **Select** | Dropdown selection with accessibility support |
| **Card** | Content containers with gradient/highlight variants |
| **ErrorMessage** | Consistent error message display |
| **LoadingSpinner** | Loading indicators with custom messages |

### Component Design Patterns

**Stateless Components**: All UI components receive data via props, business logic handled by context

**Composition over Inheritance**: Components built for reusability with flexible prop interfaces

**Accessibility-First**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

### Component Relationships

**Page Integration:**

- **Home Page**: Navigation with CTAs
- **Add Hotel Page**: Complex form with validation
- **Compare Page**: Data display with interactive elements

**State Integration:**

- Components consume HotelContext via hooks
- User interactions trigger context actions
- Real-time updates across the application
